# Building a simple CRM app with NodeJS, and MongoDB

- In this tutorial we'll use NodeJS on Repl.it, along with a MongoDB database to build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application.
- A CRM lets you store information about customers to help you track the status of every customer relationship. This can help businesses keep track of their clients and ultimately increase sales. The application will be able to store and edit customer details, as well as keep notes about them.
